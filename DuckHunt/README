This readme file could obviously use some workâ€¦


Overview:
Currently everything is controlled by the game object.  I'm not sure how valuable doing duck and dog objects would be.  Mostly I'd like to find a better way to control the chaining of animations.

I've got variables in place that would make calculating bonuses and stuff a breeze, so that could be fun.  Maybe a way to be able to create levels and send them to friends (I guess that would actually be pretty easy with some URL variables).

At some point I'll flesh this doc out...
